# Khruangbin Music Facts Loading Bar

This script creates a loading bar animation that displays random facts about the band Khruangbin while playing music-related emojis. The animation progresses in 100 steps and each fact is displayed for a certain interval, resulting in a dynamic and informative loading experience. 

## Introduction

Khruangbin is a band from Houston, Texas, known for their unique blend of musical styles from around the world, including Thai funk, surf music, and Middle Eastern melodies. The band consists of Laura Lee on bass, Mark Speer on guitar, and DJ Johnson on drums. Khruangbin has released three albums to date and has collaborated with several other artists across different genres. 

## How to Run the Script

To run the script, simply execute the `main()` function. This can be done by typing `python file_name.py` into the command line, replacing `file_name.py` with the name of the file containing the `main()` function. No additional libraries need to be installed to run the script. 

Optional arguments can be added to the `main()` function to customize the duration of the animation and the fact interval. For example:

```python
def main(total_animation_steps=100, fact_interval=5):
    # ...
```

This would allow users to adjust the animation based on their preferences.

## How to Contribute

## How to Use the Script

To use the script in a larger project, import the `main()` function into your Python code and call it as needed. The `print_loading_bar` function can also be used separately if desired.
